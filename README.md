# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v6-latest |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=lychee \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e PGID=1001 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v </path/to/appdata/config>:/config \
  -v </path/to/pictures>:/pictures \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/lychee
```


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  lychee:
    image: linuxserver/lychee
    container_name: lychee
    environment:
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - </path/to/appdata/config>:/config
      - </path/to/pictures>:/pictures
    ports:
      - 80:80
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 80` | http gui |
| `-e PUID=1001` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1001` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-v /config` | Contains all relevant configuration files. |
| `-v /pictures` | Where lychee will store uploaded data. |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Setup mysql/mariadb and account via the webui, accessible at http://SERVERIP:PORT
